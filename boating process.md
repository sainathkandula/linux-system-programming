# What is Booting Process and Its Types

Whenever the user presses the power button, the **Operating System (OS)** is automatically loaded, and the system starts working.

  So, whatever happens **before pressing the power button** and **before the OS is loaded** is called the **booting process**.

##  Types of Booting

There are **2 types of booting**:

---

###  Hard Booting Process

- Hard booting process happens whenever the user powers on the system using the **power button**.
- Also called **Cold Boot** or **Cold Start**.
- Happens when the computer is completely powered off and you press the power button to turn it on.
- The entire system goes through **POST (Power-On Self Test)** and a full **hardware reset**.

### Soft Booting Process

- Soft booting process happens when we **reset the system**.
- Also called **Restart** or **Reboot**.
- Happens when the system is already **on**, and you restart it **without turning off the power**.
- It skips some hardware checks like power supply reset but still **reloads the OS**.
