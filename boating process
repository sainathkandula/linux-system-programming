# üñ• Computer Booting Process ‚Äì Step-by-Step Explanation

When you press the power button on a computer or mobile device, a series of steps are triggered to load the operating system (OS). This process is known as **booting**. Below is a detailed breakdown of what happens during booting:

---

##  Step 1: Power Supply Turns On
- The Power Supply Unit (PSU) activates.
- Electricity flows to all key components: **CPU, RAM, motherboard, storage**, etc.
- The CPU receives power but **cannot start immediately** because there are no instructions in RAM yet.

---

##  Step 2: Boot ROM / BIOS Runs (Startup Program)
- The CPU looks for the **first instructions to execute**.
- These instructions are stored in a non-volatile memory:
  - **BIOS** (Basic Input/Output System) in older systems.
  - **Boot ROM** in embedded or mobile systems.

###  Purpose of Boot ROM/BIOS:
- Performs a **Power-On Self Test (POST)**:
  - Checks if RAM, CPU, keyboard, display, etc. are working.
  - Initializes hardware components.
- This code is in **ROM**, not RAM, because RAM is **empty at startup**.

---

## Step 3: Locating Bootable Storage
- After POST, BIOS/Boot ROM looks for a **bootable storage device**:
  - HDD (Hard Disk Drive)
  - SSD (Solid State Drive)
  - eMMC (phones, embedded)
  - USB or SD cards

---

## Step 4: Loading the Bootloader
- The system reads the **first sector** of storage.
- This sector is called the **MBR (Master Boot Record)**.

### üì¶ What is the MBR?
- A **small block (512 bytes)** at the start of the disk.
- Contains:
  - A **tiny bootloader program**
  - A **partition table** (disk layout)

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è What Happens Next?
- The MBR code is **copied into RAM**.
- The **CPU runs the bootloader code** from RAM.
- It knows how to **find and load** the OS or a larger bootloader.

---

##  Step 5: Bootloader Loads the Operating System
- A full bootloader (like **GRUB**, **U-Boot**, or **Android Bootloader**) takes over.
- It loads the **OS kernel** (Linux, Android, Windows) into RAM.

---

##  Step 6: Operating System Starts
- The OS initializes:
  - Device drivers
  - User interface (UI)
  - Background services
- You see the **login screen or desktop**.

---

##  System Ready
- The system is now ready for use.
- You can run apps, open files, browse the internet, etc.
